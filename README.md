# WAD Project by 00014952

To start testing application follow several steps. First, launch API using Visual Studio, it will create new database called "LibraryDB", initially it will be empty. Then, launch angular application using visual studio code or similar by installing npm packages and running angular project (ng serve). 

Because of empty db, populate database on frontend. First, create authors to add books, because books will require u to connect thme to specific authors. All the CRUD functionalities are present. I used Angular with pure css and .NET Core v3.1 with Entity framework which will be mentioned on report part.
